**FastScapeLib** is an interface or library (i.e. a set of subroutines) to model landscape evolution by river incision, sediment transport and deposition in continental environments.

**FastScapeLib** is a set of routines that solve (a) the stream power law (SPL) that has been enriched by a sediment transport/deposition term (see Yuan et al, 2019a in <<References>>) and (b) hillslope diffusion, using a set of highly efficient algorithms that are all O(n) complexity and implicit in time. These routines can be called from a Fortran, C or Python main program and are ideally suited to be coupled to a tectonic model, be it very simple, such as a flexural isostatic model, or very complex, such as a 3D thermo-mechanical model.

Basic partial differential equation solved by **FastScapeLib** is:

`dh/dt = U - K~f~ A^m^ S^n^ + G/A &sect;~A~ (U - dh/dt) dA + d\dx (K~d~ dh/dx) + d/dy (K~d~ dh/dy)`

where `h` is topography, `U` is uplift, `S` is slope, `A` is drainage area, and `K~f~`, `m`, `n`, `G` and `K~d~` are parameters (see further down for unit and meaning).
